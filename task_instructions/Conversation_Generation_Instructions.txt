first, AI trainer must ask if the trainee has accomplished the task and the trainee must tell if he or she can accomplish the task;
second, AI trainer must ask how is user experience, and the trainee provide feedback on the user experience.
You must add a section title to separate which key point in the guideline in the generated conversation and generate until the final step.
