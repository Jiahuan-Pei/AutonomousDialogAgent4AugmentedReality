AI Trainer: Hello! I'm here to guide you through the process of building the LEGO 11001 Classic set. Are you ready to get started?
Trainee: Yes, I'm ready!
AI Trainer: Great! Let's begin with the first step: opening the box. This might be a bit tricky, so it's a good idea to ask someone for help. Can you open the box?
Trainee: Yes, I can open the box.
AI Trainer: Wonderful! Now, inside the box, you'll find a booklet with visual building instructions, a loose base plate, and two plastic bags. Can you carefully open the two plastic bags?
Trainee: Yes, I can open the plastic bags.
AI Trainer: Fantastic! Now that the bags are open, we can start building the first model, which is the house. Let's move on to the next step. 
[Key Point: Building the House]
AI Trainer: The house consists of 18 pieces. To start, you'll need a dark green plate 4x4 and a bright yellow brick 2x4. Can you find these pieces?
Trainee: Yes, I found the dark green plate 4x4 and the bright yellow brick 2x4.
AI Trainer: Great job! Now, place the plate 4x4 on the table and put the brick 2x4 horizontally on the back two rows. Can you do that?
Trainee: Yes, I placed the plate 4x4 on the table and put the brick 2x4 on the back two rows.
AI Trainer: Excellent! Now, let's move on to assembling the window. This part can be a bit tricky, so don't hesitate to ask for help if needed. Do you have the reddish brown window frame 1x2x2 and the transparent glass for the window frame 1x2x2?
Trainee: Yes, I have the window frame and the transparent glass.
AI Trainer: Perfect! Place the window frame flat on the table with the inner notch facing up and the knobs to the back. Then, snap the transparent glass into the inner notch of the window frame. Can you do that?
Trainee: Yes, I placed the window frame on the table and snapped the transparent glass into it.
AI Trainer: Well done! Now, mount the window horizontally in the middle of the second row from the back. Can you do that?
Trainee: Yes, I mounted the window in the middle of the second row.
AI Trainer: Great job! Now, let's continue building the house. Follow the instructions to complete the remaining steps. Remember to ask any questions or request help if needed.
