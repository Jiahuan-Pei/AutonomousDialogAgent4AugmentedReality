Called the Unity tool <GetCurrentStep> and got a response: The current assembly step is: 4. ### Guidelines: LEGO Audio & Braille Building Instructions for the LEGO Friends set \"Mobile Fashion Boutique\". Drive to the rescue! Camila is going to a party and needs a makeover. Hop on the scooter and tow Stephanie's mobile boutique to deliver a style fix fast. Get Camila seated on the stool so Stephanie can work her magic. Help her style Camila's hair and add a cute bow. Pull out the mirror – Camila looks amazing! A final spray of perfume and she's party ready. On the box cover, the mobile boutique is parked on the sidewalk of a street in Heartlake City. It is a handy 4-wheel trailer that you can tow easily with a scooter. It has a window with counter, on one side an accessory stand is mounted with the different bows and hair accessories, on the other side there is a holder for lipstick and a hairbrush. The mobile boutique has an awning with orange and pink stripes, and at its top, a larger-than-life bow sign is mounted so that potential customers can see it from afar. The trailer has a fantastic feature: a swing-out mirror! The customers can take a seat on the stool in front of it and see what their new style looks like. Stephanie is standing behind the counter, showing a pink bow to Camila who is standing in front of the trailer. She has a coin in her hand to pay for her makeover! Stephanie's teal blue scooter is parked to the left of the trailer, her pink helmet on the seat. In the bottom right corner of the box cover are portraits of Stephanie and Camila. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 1 booklet with visual building instructions, 2 bags, a sheet with a mirror sticker, and 2 loose pieces: The top and bottom mold for the boutique trailer. Carefully open all bags. Before you start building, ask a sighted person to help you sort the pieces by color. This makes finding the correct pieces even easier! Put the protruding plate of the bright orange brick to the left of the previous piece, curve brick overhanging to the front. Put the protruding plate of the bright purple brick to the left of the previous piece, curve brick to the front. Collect the following 3 pieces: 2 bright orange curve bricks 1x1 with protruding plate 1x1, and 1 bright purple curve brick 1x1 with protruding plate 1x1. Continue the pattern of the last two steps: Next, put the bright orange brick to the left of the previous piece, then the bright purple one, and finish with the other bright orange brick. All curves are overhanging to the front. The trailer awning is finished! Well done! Mount it horizontally on top, connecting the accessory stand with the hairbrush and lipstick holder. Make sure the curve bricks are overhanging to the back. If done correctly, there will be 1 empty knob to the left of the awning and 1 empty knob to its right. Next up, we will build the swing-out mirror with cash register. Collect the following 2 pieces: 1 white hinge plate 1x2 - 1x2, and 1 white brick 1x2x3. Put the hinge plate 1x2 horizontally on the table. Make sure the hinge is at the front, so if you open the hinge plate, the 2 halves come to the front. For now, keep it closed so that it forms one row in front of you. Put the brick 1x2x3 horizontally on the 2 left knobs. Find 1 white roof tile 1x2, 45°. (This piece is printed.) Put it horizontally on the 2 right knobs of the hinge plate, slope to the right. This piece is printed with a light blue number pad with digital display and credit card slot. It is the cash register! Find 1 white brick 1x1. ### Conversation:\n",

      "Trainee: Yes, I'm ready. Let's begin!\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Great! The first step is to open the box. This might be a bit tricky, so I recommend asking someone to help you with it. Once you have the box open, you'll find a booklet with visual building instructions, 2 bags, a sheet with a mirror sticker, and 2 loose pieces: the top and bottom mold for the boutique trailer. Let me know when you're done opening the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: I've opened the box. I have the booklet, bags, mirror sticker sheet, and the top and bottom mold for the trailer.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Trainee: Sure, I'll ask someone to help me sort the pieces by color.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Perfect! While you're sorting the pieces, I'll explain the first step of the building process. We'll start by assembling the trailer awning. You'll need to put the bright orange and bright purple curve bricks in a specific pattern. Let me know when you're ready to begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: I'm ready. How should I place the curve bricks?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Good question! Start by putting the protruding plate of the bright orange brick to the left of the previous piece, with the curve brick overhanging to the front. Then, put the protruding plate of the bright purple brick to the left of the previous piece, also with the curve brick overhanging to the front. Finally, continue the pattern by putting the bright orange brick to the left of the previous piece, followed by the bright purple one, and finish with the other bright orange brick. All the curves should be overhanging to the front. Let me know when you're done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: I've placed the curve bricks as instructed. What's next?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Great job! Now, you can mount the trailer awning horizontally on top, connecting it with the accessory stand that has the hairbrush and lipstick holder. Make sure the curve bricks are overhanging to the back. If you've done it correctly, there should be one empty knob to the left of the awning and one empty knob to its right. Let me know when you're finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: I've mounted the trailer awning as instructed. There's one empty knob on each side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Fantastic! Now, let's move on to the next step. We'll be building the swing-out mirror with the cash register. Are you ready?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Yes, I'm ready. What pieces do I need for this step?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: For this step, you'll need a white hinge plate 1x2 - 1x2 and a white brick 1x2x3. Start by putting the hinge plate horizontally on the table, making sure the hinge is at the front. Keep it closed for now. Then, place the brick 1x2x3 horizontally on the two left knobs of the hinge plate. Let me know when you're done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: I've placed the hinge plate and the brick as instructed. What's next?\n",

      "Trainer: Great job! Now, find a white roof tile 1x2, 45°. This piece is printed. Place it horizontally on the two right knobs of the hinge plate, sloping to the right. This piece represents the cash register and has a light blue number pad with a digital display and a credit card slot. Finally, find a white brick 1x1.

      "\n",
      "Trainee: Actually, I'm having trouble visualizing the finished product. Can you show me a picture or a 3D model?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: I'm sorry, but I don't have the capability to show you a picture or a 3D model. However, I can suggest using the \"Enlarge\" tool in the Unity application to get a closer look at the current object. Would you like me to demonstrate how to use the tool?\n",

Find 1 large rectangular sticker number 1. It is the only sticker in this set. Turn the trailer from left to right. Now, the awning as well as the 4 shafts of the accessory stand should point to the front. Make sure the swing-out mirror is on the right and folded out towards the front. This means that one of its two broad side surfaces is facing you. Apply the sticker upright vertically on the front surface of the swing-out mirror. Make sure to hold the back of the mirror, otherwise it could swing back while applying. If you are not sure about the sticker application, you can always ask someone for help. Find 1 medium stone grey bottom angle plate 1x2 - 1x2 with 2 side knobs. Put it horizontally on the front row of the 4 topmost knobs, side knobs to the front. Find 1 teal blue one-stepped curve tile 2x2x⅔. Put it on the previous piece and the row behind it, curve to the back. Next, we build the fashion boutique sign.

Drive to the rescue! Camila is going to a party and needs a makeover. Hop on the scooter and tow Stephanie's mobile boutique to deliver a style fix fast. Get Camila seated on the stool so Stephanie can work her magic. Help her style Camila's hair and add a cute bow. Pull out the mirror – Camila looks amazing! A final spray of perfume and she's party ready. On the box cover, the mobile boutique is parked on the sidewalk of a street in Heartlake City. It is a handy 4-wheel trailer that you can tow easily with a scooter. It has a window with counter, on one side an accessory stand is mounted with the different bows and hair accessories, on the other side there is a holder for lipstick and a hairbrush. The mobile boutique has an awning with orange and pink stripes, and at its top, a larger-than-life bow sign is mounted so that potential customers can see it from afar. The trailer has a fantastic feature: a swing-out mirror! The customers can take a seat on the stool in front of it and see what their new style looks like. Stephanie is standing behind the counter, showing a pink bow to Camila who is standing in front of the trailer. She has a coin in her hand to pay for her makeover! Stephanie's teal blue scooter is parked to the left of the trailer, her pink helmet on the seat. In the bottom right corner of the box cover are portraits of Stephanie and Camila. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 1 booklet with visual building instructions, 2 bags, a sheet with a mirror sticker, and 2 loose pieces: The top and bottom mold for the boutique trailer. Carefully open all bags. Before you start building, ask a sighted person to help you sort the pieces by color. This makes finding the correct pieces even easier! Put the plate 1x3 horizontally on the table. The next piece will be mounted at an angle. Pay close attention to the instructions below! Put the wedge plate on the leftmost knob, its main corner pointing to the middle knob, the cut-off corner to the left. Find another lemon yellow wedge plate 2x2 with 45° corner and 3 knobs. Put it on the rightmost knob, its main corner pointing to the middle knob, the cut-off corner to the right. Together, they should form the shape of a large bow. Find 1 lemon yellow plate 1x3. Put it horizontally in the middle of the bow. Find 1 salmon pink heart-shaped tile 1x1. Put it on the middle knob of the previous piece, heart tip to the front. The fashion boutique sign is finished! Great job! Flip it upright and mount it centered on the 2 side knobs pointing to the front at the top. Collect the following 4 pieces: 1 light purple flower piece 1x1 with pin, 1 purple violet hair bow with heart knot and pin, 1 transparent bright bluish violet pair of sunglasses with pin, and 1 transparent raspberry red pair of sunglasses with pin. You can insert the small pins on these and similar pieces into the 4 shafts pointing to the front on the accessory stand. The hairpieces of the Minidolls have small holes at the top. The pins of the accessories fit into those holes. ### Conversation:\n",

Drive to the rescue! Camila is going to a party and needs a makeover. Hop on the scooter and tow Stephanie's mobile boutique to deliver a style fix fast. Get Camila seated on the stool so Stephanie can work her magic. Help her style Camila's hair and add a cute bow. Pull out the mirror – Camila looks amazing! A final spray of perfume and she's party ready. On the box cover, the mobile boutique is parked on the sidewalk of a street in Heartlake City. It is a handy 4-wheel trailer that you can tow easily with a scooter. It has a window with counter, on one side an accessory stand is mounted with the different bows and hair accessories, on the other side there is a holder for lipstick and a hairbrush. The mobile boutique has an awning with orange and pink stripes, and at its top, a larger-than-life bow sign is mounted so that potential customers can see it from afar. The trailer has a fantastic feature: a swing-out mirror! The customers can take a seat on the stool in front of it and see what their new style looks like. Stephanie is standing behind the counter, showing a pink bow to Camila who is standing in front of the trailer. She has a coin in her hand to pay for her makeover! Stephanie's teal blue scooter is parked to the left of the trailer, her pink helmet on the seat. In the bottom right corner of the box cover are portraits of Stephanie and Camila. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 1 booklet with visual building instructions, 2 bags, a sheet with a mirror sticker, and 2 loose pieces: The top and bottom mold for the boutique trailer. Carefully open all bags. Before you start building, ask a sighted person to help you sort the pieces by color. This makes finding the correct pieces even easier! The scooter is finished! Great job! Snap its right clasp on the shaft on the left edge of the trailer. You can now tow the trailer to its next pop-up location! ### Conversation:\n",

Build your very own LEGO version of a harvester machine from world-famous tractor maker CLAAS! It features the iconic green, red and gray color scheme just like the real CLAAS XERION machines. It is harvest time and your wheat crops are ready to be cut and brought home! The CLAAS XERION harvester with its flexible steering and rotary cutters at the back is the perfect machine for this job. Insiders' tip: this LEGO Technic set is a neat 2-in-1 package: alternatively, you can also build the CLAAS XERION tractor with it! If you haven't built anything with this set yet, open the box. It contains a booklet with visual building instructions, a large and a small plastic bag as well as a sticker sheet with four stickers. Open both plastic bags carefully. If you have built the tractor before, take everything apart. Before you get started, ask a sighted person to help you sort the bricks by color. This way, you will be even faster in finding the correct pieces! You will have plenty of spare parts left. Make sure to keep them! If you want to rebuild the harvester into the tractor, you will need most of those spare parts. ### Conversation:\n",

Visit Disney's Anna in Arendelle Castle! Come inside and check the time on the big grandfather clock. Have a snack before dancing with Anna and Olaf in the ballroom. Tired? Head to Anna's bedroom and have a nap. There's more fun to be had, so rest up! Feed Kjekk a carrot while Anna brushes him, then put his saddle on to go for a ride. When you're back, it's time to see what else you can find! The box cover shows the ocher and teal blue castle in the magical scenery of Arendelle. In the background, there are sunlit mountains and lake Arendelle. On the right side in the back are the hills and meadows of the town, a few houses and trees. Judging from the foliage, it must be fall. The two-story castle in the center of the scene has 1 main tower and 2 smaller towers and a magnificent double door with golden ornaments and door knobs. It stands on a pebbled path. Anna and Olaf are standing in front of the castle next to a treasure chest and the drinking trough for Anna's horse Kjekk. The white horse with grey mane is actually standing on the left edge quenching his thirst as we speak! In the bottom right corner, there is a detailed portrait of cartoon Anna wearing her purple cloak, her hair loosely blowing in the wind. The bottom of the box cover is of a glistening ice blue with ice blue LEGO bricks and pieces mimicking an icy river. Let's get started! Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 2 booklets with visual building instructions, 2 bags with numbers printed on them, and 3 loose pieces: a horse figurine, the base plate for the castle and an ornate archway. Ask a sighted person to help you find the correct bag! Find 2 teal blue roof tiles 1x2x2, 65°. Put 1 horizontally on the 2 right knobs on top of the 4 previous pieces, slope to the right. Put the other one horizontally to the left of the previous piece, slope to the left. Find 1 warm gold triple-sloped roof tile 1x2, 45°. Put it horizontally on top of the 2 previous pieces, slopes to the back, to the left and to the right. The top floor of the castle is finished! Well done! ### Conversation:\n",

Visit the forest with Elsa and discover Nokk’s ice stable, nestled in the trees. Look at the icicles and gems hanging from the branches. On top of the stable is a sparkling snowflake. Open the chest and find some carrots to feed the Nokk. Help Elsa brush the Nokk, then go for an exciting ride through the snow! The box cover shows the Enchanted Forest. It is winter there, so the ground is covered in snow, and in the foreground, you can see the bank of an icy river or lake. A lot of different ice-blue LEGO bricks and pieces are floating in the icy water. There are a few red leaves on the ground, and several trees in the background. In the middle, the Nokk is standing in its ice stable while Elsa is gently brushing its mane. A chest filled with carrots is waiting for the Nokk. It definitely likes these yummy treats! In the right bottom corner of the box cover is a portrait of Elsa in a beautifully embroidered pale blue dress, her platinum blonde hair plaited in her signature hairstyle. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 1 booklet with visual building instructions, 1 plastic bag, and 2 loose pieces: one plate 8x8 with half circle, and 1 horse frame. Carefully open the plastic bag. Before you start building, ask a sighted person to help you sort the pieces by color. This makes finding the correct pieces even easier! Put the chest bottom on the table. The wall on one long side is lower than the other three side walls. This is where the chest lid will go. Take the chest lid and find the two little studs on one long side. Snap those studs into the notches inside the chest, fitting the lid into the lower side wall of the chest. Find 2 bright orange carrots. Put them into the chest. The chest is finished! Well done! You can open and close it as needed. It is a great storage place for the Nokk's treats, but you can keep all kinds of things in this chest. ### Conversation:\n",

When a crook uses his drone to steal a valuable statue, it is time to launch the police helicopter and bring him to justice. Patrol the LEGO City streets from above with the exciting Sky Police Drone Chase set, featuring a police helicopter with opening minifigure cockpit, spinning rotor, searchlight and firing net shooter. This fun police play set also includes a buildable drone with spinning rotors and opening claws, a golden minifigure statue with pedestal, remote-control element, handcuffs and 2 minifigures. Includes 3 LEGO City minifigures: a crook and a Sky Police officer figure, plus a golden minifigure statue. Open the box. This is tricky for everyone; ask someone to help you! The box contains two booklets with visual building instructions, a sticker set, and two plastic bags. They are labelled with the numbers 1 and 2. Ask a sighted person to help you find the correct bag. Take the black net 10x10 out of the little box. Scrunch up the net and put it into the wide opening of the shooter barrel. Pull the trigger back and push it to eject the net. The helicopter is finished! Well done! Seat the Sky police officer in the cockpit and let him chase after the crook! Maybe he can even catch the crook with the net. ### Conversation:\n",

This set comes with a cool Minifigure driver and his awesome Monster Truck. The truck has big wheels with huge off-road tires and a very impressive decoration of a monster head on the hood. On the box cover the driver is participating in a competition and is jumping over a sandbar at full speed with the Monster Truck. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains a booklet with visual building instructions, and unnumbered bags. Open the bags carefully. Before you get started, ask a sighted person to help you sort the pieces. This way it will be easier for you to find the right pieces during building. First, we will build the driver Minifigure. Find 1 bright yellowish green pair of legs. Find 1 bright yellowish green and medium lilac upper part of the body. Put the upper body horizontally on top of the legs. The Monster Truck driver is wearing a driving jacket with medium lilac sleeves and flames on both sides of the jacket. He's also wearing white driving gloves and green pants. Find 1 bright yellow head. Put it on top. The driver has a stubble and a daring smile on his face. Now, we will assemble the crash helmet for the Minifigure. Find 1 white crash helmet. Find 1 transparent helmet visor. Careful! This build can be a bit tricky. Put the helmet visor upright on the side opening of the crash helmet, bow of the visor facing outward. Once the visor is attached you can tilt it up, so the crash helmet can stay open or closed. ### Conversation:\n",

This set comes with a cool bulldozer with a trailer. Also included are a cement mixer and a tower with a wrecking ball. The 2 included construction workers are busy tearing down walls and clearing them away. On the front of the box one of the construction workers is driving the bulldozer moving rubble around. He also has a trailer attached to the bulldozer carrying a cement mixer. In the background the other construction worker is sitting in the crane tower swinging the wrecking ball knocking down some wall parts. A sign and 2 cones stand in the construction site as warnings. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 2 booklets with visual building instructions and 2 numbered bags. You also have to find 2 grease bands made of rubber. They are loose in the box. Find 1 bright red contractor's helmet. Put it on top. The construction worker is now finished. Well done! Now, we will build the crane tower with the wrecking ball. Find 1 sand yellow octagonal plate 10x10 with a hole in the center. Put it on the table. Make sure one of the 4 straight edges is facing you. If put down correctly, the knobs on the plate form columns and rows in front of you. Be careful not to pick one of the 4 diagonal edges. Find 2 medium stone grey roof tiles 2x2. Put them on the rightmost two columns, slopes to the right. Find 1 bright yellow lattice wall 1x6x5. Put it vertically centered to the left of the previous elements. ### Conversation:\n",

Hold tight as you power through the flames and make a perfect landing. On the box cover, the members of the LEGO City Stunt Team are performing some daring moves over the fire ramp. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains a booklet with visual building instructions and unnumbered bags. Open the bags carefully. Before you get started, ask a sighted person to help you sort the bricks by color. This way, you will be even faster in finding the right piece! In the next section we will build a green motorbike. Find 1 black motorcycle frame. Put it horizontally on the table, front forks to the left and pointing down. The front forks are the steeper pair of forks. Find 1 mossy green motorcycle fairing. Careful! This can be tricky, ask someone to help you if needed. Put it horizontally on the motorcycle frame, the two top knobs to the right. The fairing has lightnings airbrushed on the sides. Find 1 medium stone grey handle with shaft. Click the shaft of the handle into the clasp underneath the protective hood on the left side, handle ends to the right. We are now going to build the wheels. Find 2 bright yellowish green rims. Find 2 black tyres. ### Conversation:\n",

Maneuver the propeller-driven craft into position and use the inspection arms to retrieve the diamonds. But watch out for the hammerhead shark circling the sub! It's just another day for a LEGO City Ocean explorer. On the box cover, the submarine pilot Minifigure is aboard the Mini-Submarine exploring the sea, floating down from the top right corner. The underwater vehicle is bright yellow, has a huge transparent bubble cockpit in the middle front and two black propellers at the back, and the top of the minisub is white and dark blue. At the bottom left, they have just discovered a treasure chest with beautiful diamonds in it! Wow! One of the diamonds is already in the inspection arm for closer inspection. And at the bottom right, there is a magnificent hammerhead shark floating in the sea. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains a booklet with visual building instructions, one plastic bag, and three loose elements: the shark body, the bubble cockpit and the submarine bottom. Carefully open the plastic bag. Before you start building, ask a sighted person to help you sort the pieces by color. This makes finding the correct pieces even easier! Find 2 bright yellow bricks 1x4. Put them vertically to the left and right of the previous piece. Find 1 bright yellow brick 1x2. Put it horizontally on the backmost row in the middle. Find 2 medium stone grey bricks 1x2 with connector on long side. Put them horizontally to the left and right of the previous piece, connectors to the back. Find 2 earth blue bricks 1x3.

Vroom! Clara the Criminal is making a twilight escape in a superfast speedboat loaded with stolen treasure. Mobilize LEGO City TV hero Duke DeTain and race to the scene in the armored off-roader. Then unload the cool police dinghy from the trailer, grab the night vision goggles and set off in hot pursuit before she escapes into the darkness. Another action-packed LEGO City Police adventure! On the box cover, you can see the armored police off-roader complete with detachable boat trailer standing at the beach; the truck is a chic night blue with yellow horizontal stripes and yellow POLICE signs on the sides as well as a white roof with flashing blue lights. The trailer is designed in the LEGO City police colors, as well, and has red rear lights. The LEGO City skyline is the serene backdrop of the scene, while at the front, Clara the Criminal is speeding off in her blazing red speedboat with cool black rear spoilers. But not to worry, police officer Duke DeTain is already hard on her heels in his yellow police dinghy! Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains two booklets with visual building instructions, two large plastic bags with numbers printed on them, and one unnumbered plastic bag; ask a sighted person to help you find the correct bag! Carefully open bag 1 and any small sub-bags in it, as well as the unnumbered plastic bag. Bag 1 contains the bricks and pieces for the Duke DeTain Minifigure and the police off-roader jeep, the extra bag contains the dinghy boat and the tires of the jeep. Before you start building, ask a sighted person to help you sort the pieces by color. This way, finding pieces and building will be even easier! First, we will build the Duke DeTain Minifigure. Collect the following 4 pieces: 1 bright yellow head, 1 earth blue pair of legs, 1 white football helmet, and 1 sand blue and black upper part of the body. Assemble the Minifigure: stack the upper part of the body on the legs, put the head on top, and place the helmet on the head. Duke DeTain has a broad grin on his face and is wearing cool sunglasses. He is all ready to catch Clara the Criminal! Will he succeed? You decide! Find 1 black pair of night vision goggles. Snap them onto the helmet. The Duke DeTain Minifigure is finished! Well done! He is wearing blue pants and a light blue shirt. On top of that, he is wearing a grey police vest with many pockets for his technical equipment. Thanks to the night vision goggles, Clara the Criminal won't stand a chance! Next, we will build the police off-roader jeep. Find 1 dark stone grey plate 2x12. Put it horizontally on the table. ### Conversation:\n",

The LEGO City Police are transporting the notorious crook Snake Rattler in their iconic prisoner transporter, when... BOOM! An explosion has blasted the cell free from the transporter and Clara The Criminal is dragging the cell away at high speed in her souped-up tow truck. Call in police hero Duke DeTain on his supercool black motorcycle and intercept those crooks before they get away! The box cover shows a breathtaking car chase in LEGO City. The police transporter, shown from the side, is in the back center of the cover driving on a road from right to left. Snake Rattler is safely locked in the cell at the transporter rear, but oh no! It is on the cusp of falling off because Clara the Criminal has hijacked it with her tow truck. She is pulling the cell off the transporter and off the road at lightning speed towards the front left! The policewoman driving the truck looks desperate, there is nothing she can do. But not to worry, Duke DeTain is already chasing after the tow truck on his cool motorcycle, coming from the front right. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 2 booklets with visual building instructions, 3 plastic bags with numbers printed on them, and a sheet with stickers. Ask a sighted person to help you find the correct bag! Collect the following 2 pieces: 1 bright red brick 1x4, and 1 pale ocher yellow plate 1x2. Put the brick 1x4 vertically to the left of the previous piece. Put the plate 1x2 vertically to the left of the previous piece. Next, we will build the truck front with license plate. Find 1 black top angle plate 1x2 - 1x4 with 4 side knobs. Put it horizontally on the table, side knobs pointing towards you. Find 1 dark stone grey flat tile 1x2. Put it upright horizontally on the 2 middle side knobs. Continue if you want to decorate this piece with a sticker now. If not, skip the next 3 sentences. Find 1 small rectangular sticker number 4. Ask a sighted person to help you find the correct sticker. Put it upright horizontally on the previous piece. The sticker again is printed with the license plate and looks exactly like the first license plate sticker. It is white with a bold black frame. The license number is \"T Y 0 1 2 0 3\" which is printed on in black letters. The truck front with license plate is finished! Well done!

      "The task it to generate multiple turns of conversations and called tools between trainer (assistant) and trainee (user) grounded on the task-specific guidelines and tools in LEGO XR application. Imagine some trainee's utterances have the intent of using the tools with the following responses: Called the Unity tool <NextStep> and got a response: Moved to the next assembly step: 4. 6 steps remaining. Called the Unity tool <CheckStepStatusVR> and got a response: The current assembly step in Unity is accomplished correctly. Called the Unity tool <FinishedVideo> and got a response: Ended the assembly process. Showing a video of the assembled LEGO bricks. Called the Unity tool <Explode> and got a response: Triggered explosion for detailed viewing. Use 'Recover' to restore the initial state. ### Guidelines: LEGO Audio & Braille Building Instructions for the LEGO City set \"Police Prisoner Transport\". The LEGO City Police are transporting the notorious crook Snake Rattler in their iconic prisoner transporter, when... BOOM! An explosion has blasted the cell free from the transporter and Clara The Criminal is dragging the cell away at high speed in her souped-up tow truck. Call in police hero Duke DeTain on his supercool black motorcycle and intercept those crooks before they get away! The box cover shows a breathtaking car chase in LEGO City. The police transporter, shown from the side, is in the back center of the cover driving on a road from right to left. Snake Rattler is safely locked in the cell at the transporter rear, but oh no! It is on the cusp of falling off because Clara the Criminal has hijacked it with her tow truck. She is pulling the cell off the transporter and off the road at lightning speed towards the front left! The policewoman driving the truck looks desperate, there is nothing she can do. But not to worry, Duke DeTain is already chasing after the tow truck on his cool motorcycle, coming from the front right. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 2 booklets with visual building instructions, 3 plastic bags with numbers printed on them, and a sheet with stickers. Ask a sighted person to help you find the correct bag! Snap the glass into the hollow of the wall element. Use the 2 small bumps on the glass and the 2 small notches at the top and bottom on the inside of the wall element. Mount this side window on the frontmost row on the right edge of the higher part, panel to the front. Now, we will make the second side window. Find 1 transparent light blue glass for frame 1x2x2. Find 1 white wall element 1x2x2 with window cut-out. Assemble it just like the first window: snap the small bumps on the window glass into the small notches on the inside of the wall element. Mount the second side window horizontally on the backmost row on the right edge of the high part, panel to the back. Find 1 transparent light blue windscreen 2x6x2. Put it vertically on the leftmost column, slope to the left. Collect the following 3 pieces: 1 dark stone grey grille tile 1x2, and 2 dark stone grey plates 1x2 with hinge fork on short end. ### Conversation:\n",

      "Trainee: Hi! I'm following the LEGO Audio & Braille Building Instructions for the LEGO City set \"Police Prisoner Transport\". I've completed the previous step. What should I do next?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Great job on completing the previous step! Let's move on to the next one. Give me a moment to use the Unity tool <NextStep> to determine the next assembly step... Done! The tool has moved us to the next assembly step: Step 4. There are 6 steps remaining. Now, let's continue with the instructions for Step 4. \n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Thank you! I'm ready to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Perfect! In Step 4, we will be working on the side windows of the transporter. Find one transparent light blue glass for frame 1x2x2 and one white wall element 1x2x2 with a window cut-out. Can you locate these pieces?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Yes, I found them.\n",

      "\n",
      "Trainee: Done!\n",

      "Trainer: Great work! Now, for the next step, you need to collect three pieces: one dark stone grey grille tile 1x2, and two dark stone grey plates 1x2 with a hinge fork on the short end. Can you find these pieces?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Yes, I found them.\n",

      "\n",
      "Trainee: Actually, I'm curious to see how the assembled LEGO bricks will look like. Can we see a video of the assembled model?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Absolutely! Let's use the Unity tool <FinishedVideo> to end the assembly process and show you a video of the assembled LEGO bricks. Give me a moment... Done! The tool has ended the assembly process and is now showing a video of the assembled LEGO bricks. Enjoy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: That's amazing! The model looks great. Thank you for showing me the video.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: You're welcome! I'm glad you liked it. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Actually, I have one more question. What happens if I want to see the details of a specific part of the model?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: That's a great question! If you want to see the details of a specific part, you can use the Unity tool <Explode> to trigger an explosion for detailed viewing. However, after the explosion, you can use the Unity tool <Recover> to restore the initial state of the AR objects. This way, you can explore the details without losing your progress. Let me know if you need any further clarification on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Thank you for explaining! I'll keep that in mind.\n",

      "The task it to generate multiple turns of conversations and called tools between trainer (assistant) and trainee (user) grounded on the task-specific guidelines and tools in LEGO XR application. Imagine some trainee's utterances have the intent of using the tools with the following responses: Called the Unity tool <CheckStepStatusVR> and got a response: The current assembly step in Unity is accomplished correctly. Called the Unity tool <APICallObjectRecognitionAR> and got a response: Called the VLM agent to identify LEGO pieces based on video streaming data from AR glasses. Called the Unity tool <NextStep> and got a response: Moved to the next assembly step: 5. 5 steps remaining. Called the Unity tool <Explode> and got a response: Triggered explosion for detailed viewing. Use 'Recover' to restore the initial state. ### Guidelines: LEGO Audio & Braille Building Instructions for the LEGO City set \"Beach Rescue ATV\". Head for the coast with the LEGO City Beach Rescue ATV. Unload the cool water scooter from the trailer and launch it into the ocean. Help the lifeguard patrol the coastal waters. Power through the surf, taking care not to harm the nearby shark. When you're done patrolling the area, load up the water scooter, jump aboard the all-terrain vehicle, secure the roll cage and move on to the next beach! On the box cover, the lifeguard is riding the water scooter at the shore in the front left corner of the cover, handlebar in the left hand and binoculars in the right. But in that moment, he is spotting the shark to his left appearing on the water surface. In the back of the scene, the beach all-terrain vehicle with boat trailer is parked on the sandy beach. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 1 booklet with visual building instructions and 2 plastic bags with numbers printed on them. Ask a sighted person to help you find the correct bag! Find 1 white plate 1x2. Put it horizontally on the table. Find 1 transparent light blue flat tile 1x2. Put it horizontally on top. Mount this part upright horizontally on the upper side knobs on the left side. Find 1 bright yellow one-stepped curve tile 2x2x⅔. (This piece is printed.) Put it on the leftmost four knobs, slope to the left. This piece is printed with the same design as the curve tile on the water scooter: the blue Star of Life symbol in a white circle that is surrounded by a thick blue frame, another thin white frame, and a thin blue outline. In the thick blue frame, the words \"BEACH RESCUE\" are printed on in white letters, and there are four white stripes to the left and right of the Star of Life. Find 1 black driver's cab 4x6x3. This will be the roll cage of the ATV. Turn it horizontally so that the two bottom bars are on the left and right. Then, snap the bottom bar on the left into the two clasps on the top left of the vehicle. If done correctly, you can now open and close the roll cage on its right side. Find 1 bright yellow rounded plate 1x2. ### Conversation:\n",

The time has arrived... It's race day! Jump into the SUV off-roader and head for the race circuit. Lower the trailer ramps and unload the supercool Baja buggy. Lift the roll cage and climb aboard. Put on your safety helmet. Ready, steady, GO! Power away from the starting line, steer around bends, zoom down straights and thunder across the finish line to break the LEGO City speed record! On the box cover, the Baja race buggy is shown flying in mid-air, racing across rocky terrain! The male driver is seated in the buggy, of course wearing safety helmet and goggles. The buggy has a cool design: with its large balloon tires, massive rear spoilers, black and dark purple paint coatings, and many racing-related stickers, it is quite the eye-catcher! This time, the female driver is watching from a safe distance in the back. She is holding the wrench, all ready to fix the buggy after the race. In the back of the scene, the SUV off-roader with trailer is parked, it is shown from the front and right side. The vehicle is green and has grey mudguards, a white removable roof and a white horizontal line in the body paint. It easily seats two people. The trailer is grey, and it is equipped with an octane fuel cylinder, a fire extinguisher and some tools. In addition, the ramps of the trailer can be folded up and down for easy loading and safe transporting. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 2 booklets with visual building instructions, 3 plastic bags with numbers printed on them, and a sheet with stickers. Ask a sighted person to help you find the correct bag! Put it horizontally on top, starting with the left back corner, 1 row overhanging to the front and 10 columns overhanging to the right. Find 1 dark green bottom angle plate 1x2 - 1x2 with 2 side knobs. Put it horizontally underneath the front row of the previous piece on the left edge, side knobs pointing to the front. Find 1 medium stone grey plate 4x6. Put it horizontally underneath the rightmost 2 columns of the structure, 4 columns protruding to the right, 1 row protuding to the back and 1 to the front. Collect the following 3 pieces: 2 bright blue plates 1x4, and 1 white flat tile 2x4. Put the flat tile 2x4 horizontally on the 2 middle rows, starting from the right edge. Make sure the short sides of the tile and the previous piece touch. Put 1 plate 1x4 horizontally behind the previous piece. Repeat symmetrically at the front. Find 1 bright blue inverted curve disk 2x2. First, flip the structure upside down. Make sure the left and right sides remain the same. Identify the lowest level of the structure (it only consists of 2 rows and has no side knobs) and put the inverted curve disk in the middle of that section. Find 2 black one-stepped bearing elements 2x2 with side pin connector. ### Conversation:\n",

Put it vertically to the right of the 2 previous pieces. Collect the following 2 pieces: 1 black wrench, and 1 black hammer. Snap their handles horizontally into the 2 clasps to the left of the previous piece. If you cannot mount them horizontally, the plates 1x1 with top clasp could be mounted incorrectly. Now, we build the octane fuel cylinder. Find 1 white round brick 2x2 with top cross hole. Put it on the table. Find 1 dark green round plate 2x2. Put it on top. Find 1 bright red round plate 2x2. Put it on top. ### Conversation:\n",

Unload the jet from the trailer, grab your air mask and prepare for takeoff. Check your flight helmet before thundering down the runway and into the sky. Perform supersonic flybys and crowd-thrilling loops! Make a cool landing and use the marshaling wands to guide the pilot back to the truck. Enjoy awesome action at the LEGO City airshow! On the box cover, the jet airplane is in the middle of an incredible stunt: it is doing a turn, meaning that the whole plane is upside down! For show effect, the jet trail is red instead of the usual white. The plane is a flame yellowish orange with white wings, tinted cokpit, large tail fins and 3 landing gears. The pilot is handling the plane and stunt confidently. The driver of the jet transporter is standing in the right front corner of the box cover next to the toolbox for the plane. She is using the marshaling wands to guide the pilot and plane. The jet transporter, which is an articulated truck, is parked on the side of the runway, its tractor unit is shown from the front and left side, and the trailer is extending towards the right back. The transporter truck is black, red, and white and has 4 large wheels on the tractor unit and 8 smaller wheels on the trailer. In the back of the scene, the airport with tower as well as the stand for the visitors of the airshow are depicted, and the skyline of LEGO City is behind all that. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 2 booklets with visual building instructions, 3 plastic bags with numbers printed on them, and one sheet with stickers. Ask a sighted person to help you find the correct bag! Find 2 transparent plates 1x2. Put 1 horizontally on the back row on the left edge. Repeat symmetrically on the right. Find 1 bright red relief plate 2x6x⅔ with 4 raised top knobs and 4 side knobs. Put it horizontally underneath the overhanging row at the back, raised knobs and side knobs to the back. Find 2 black one-stepped curve tiles 2x2x⅔. Put 1 on the left edge at the back, curve to the left. Repeat symmetrically on the right. Find 1 black flat tile 2x2. Put it between the 2 previous pieces. Find 1 black grille tile 1x2. Put it horizontally centered on the second row from the front. ### Conversation:\n",

      "Trainer: Great! The first step is to open the box. It might be a bit tricky, so I recommend asking someone to help you with this. Once you have the box open, you'll find a booklet with visual building instructions, a bag with bricks, and a loose piece, which is a wagon bottom 6x10. Can you open the box and confirm if you have these items?\n",

      "Trainee: Let me check... Yes, I found the black wagon bottom 6x10 and the bright yellow one-stepped plate 2x2x⅔.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Great job! Now, place the wagon bottom 6x10 horizontally on the table with the pin connectors pointing to the front and back. Then, put the one-stepped plate on the 4 rightmost knobs in the middle, with the side knobs pointing to the right. Can you do that?\n",

      "\n",
      "Trainee: Let me search for the transparent red flat tile 1x2... Found it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Perfect! Now, flip the piece upright and mount it horizontally on the 2 side knobs of the previous piece. This will be the rear light of the race car. Can you do that?\n",

      "Trainee: Wait, I have a question. How do I know if I'm doing the assembly correctly?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: That's a great question! In this XR application, we have a tool called CheckStepStatusVR that allows us to check if the current step in Unity is accomplished correctly or not. If the current assembly sequence recorded in Unity matches the manual assembly sequence, then it is correct. If there are any discrepancies, we'll need to make adjustments. Does that make sense?\n",
      "\n",

      " Trainer: Hello! Welcome back to the LEGO XR application. Are you ready to continue building the LEGO City Race Car?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Yes, I'm ready to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Great! Let's move on to the next step. According to the guidelines, we need to put the plate 2x4 horizontally on the table. Can you do that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Sure, I've placed the plate 2x4 horizontally on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Excellent! Now, we need to put the handrail 1x4x2 horizontally on the back row. Can you find this piece and place it in the correct position?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Let me find the handrail 1x4x2... Found it! I've placed it horizontally on the back row.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Well done! Now, let's move on to the next part. We need to collect a black hammer and a silver metallic wrench. Can you find these two pieces?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Let me search for the black hammer and the silver metallic wrench... Found them!\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Great job! Now, insert the handle of the hammer top-to-bottom into the left knob of the handrail. Then, insert the handle of the wrench into the right knob. This will complete the tool rack. Can you do that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: I've inserted the handle of the hammer into the left knob and the handle of the wrench into the right knob. The tool rack is finished!\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Fantastic! The mechanic is now ready for the next pit stop. She can fix just about any issue. You're doing a great job! Let's move on to the next step. (Called the Unity tool <NextStep>)\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Wait, before we move on, I want to check the current assembly step. (Called the Unity tool <GetCurrentStep>)\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Sure, go ahead and check the current assembly step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: (Called the Unity tool <GetCurrentStep>) The current assembly step is: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Thank you for checking. Now, let's move on to the next step. (Called the Unity tool <NextStep>)\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Hold on, I want to try using the tool to rotate the current object. (Called the Unity tool <Rotate>)\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Sure, go ahead and give it a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: (Called the Unity tool <Rotate>) I rotated the current object 6 times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Great job! You're getting the hang of using the tools. Now, let's move on to the next step. (Called the Unity tool <NextStep>)\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Wait, I want to try using the tool to trigger an explosion for detailed viewing. (Called the Unity tool <Explode>)\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: Sure, go ahead and trigger the explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: (Called the Unity tool <Explode>) I triggered the explosion for detailed viewing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainer: That's awesome! Just remember to use the 'Recover' tool to restore the initial state after the explosion. This will allow us to continue with the assembly process.\n",

      "The task it to generate multiple turns of conversations and called tools between trainer (assistant) and trainee (user) grounded on the task-specific guidelines and tools in LEGO XR application. Imagine some trainee's utterances have the intent of using the tools with the following responses: Called the Unity tool <Shrink> and got a response: Shrunk or zoomed in the current object. Called the Unity tool <FinishedVideo> and got a response: Ended the assembly process. Showing a video of the assembled LEGO bricks. Called the Unity tool <NextStep> and got a response: Moved to the next assembly step: 2. 1 steps remaining. Called the Unity tool <APICallCheckStepStatusAR> and got a response: Called the VLM agent to determine if the current assembly step is completed correctly based on video streaming data from AR glasses. Called the Unity tool <ReShow> and got a response: Repeating the current assembly step: 2. ### Guidelines: LEGO Audio & Braille Building Instructions for the Lego Movie set \"Emmet and Benny's 'Build and Fix' Workshop\". Enjoy a stellar building experience with THE LEGO MOVIE 2 Emmet and Benny's Build and Fix Workshop! This LEGO set features Benny's spaceship with mini figure cockpit, foldout boosters and removable space buggy, as well as Emmet's Escape Car with Flames, plus 2 mini figures, a gas and repair station, and a tool trolley with assorted tool elements to fix your vehicles. Open the box. This can be tricky for everyone; ask someone to help you. The box contains a booklet with visual building instructions, one loose piece (it is the ship front of the spaceship), and two plastic bags. They are printed with the numbers 1 and 2. Ask a sighted person to help you find the correct bag! The first foldout booster is finished! Mount it on the hinge fingers on the right side of the structure at the back, knobs overhanging to the front. Try folding out the booster towards the back! Next, we will build the second foldout booster. Find 1 medium stone grey booster piece 4x4x2. Put it knob-side up on the table. Find 1 medium stone grey plate 2x2 with 2 knobs and 1 top hinge part. Put it on top. The second foldout booster is finished! Mount it on the hinge fingers on the right side of the structure at the front, knobs overhanging to the back. Try folding out the booster towards the front! Find 2 transparent red plates 1x2. Put one vertically on the rightmost column of the ship front, starting from the back. Repeat symmetrically at the front. Find 2 medium stone grey roof tiles 2x2. ### Conversation:\n",

      "The task it to generate multiple turns of conversations and called tools between trainer (assistant) and trainee (user) grounded on the task-specific guidelines and tools in LEGO XR application. Imagine some trainee's utterances have the intent of using the tools with the following responses: Called the Unity tool <HighlightCorrectComponents> and got a response: Highlighted correct attachment points and components. Called the Unity tool <CheckStepStatusVR> and got a response: The current assembly step in Unity is accomplished correctly. Called the Unity tool <ShowPieces> and got a response: Showing all candidate LEGO pieces to be assembled. ### Guidelines: LEGO Audio & Braille Building Instructions for the LEGO Super Mario Expansion set \"Dorrie's Beachfront Expansion Set\". Note: This is an expansion set. The LEGO Mario and LEGO Luigi figures are not included. The LEGO Super Mario Starter course is required for play. Note that you might have to connect Mario with the free LEGO Super Mario App and update him in order to get the full range of sounds, features and reactions to the different elements in this set. However, the basic functions and reactions also work without updating, so you can also do that later if you wish. In case you are using the app with your LEGO Mario sets, you will be able to register this set by scanning a sticker code after you have built Dorrie. So let's get started! It's LEGO Mario time again! Take a coin-collecting ride on the beach with Dorrie! Jump on the friendly character and start exploring. Toss the green shell to defeat the Huckit Crab, then search for 1, 2, 3 Blocks: destroy the sandcastle, splash in the water fountain and wobble the tree! Challenge friends to beat your best coin score, and then rebuild to create an exciting new level. This fun LEGO Mario expansion set includes the following modules that you can combine any way you like: 1 Dorrie figure, 1 Sandcastle module with Block 1, 1 Water Fountain module with Block 2, 1 Launcher module with Green Shell, 1 Huckit Crab module, 1 Tree module, 1 Small Water Fountain module, and 1 Grass module. These modules do not have a fixed order. At the end, or whenever you have a few modules finished, you can use the connecting plates of different lengths to build your very own course! Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains 1 booklet with general information on the different LEGO Mario sets, and 3 bags with numbers printed on them. Ask a sighted person to help you find the correct bag! Find 4 pale ocher yellow nose cones 1x1. Put them on the 4 corners of the Sandcastle walls. The Sandcastle module is finished! Well done! If Mario wants to get to the Block number 1, there is no other way than to destroy the Sandcastle. Try kicking the shovel to the left and right to break down the castle walls! But you can also leave the sandcastle intact for now. It will work best once all modules are connected. Next, we build the Water Fountain module with Block number 2. Find 1 dark azure blue plate 6x6x⅔ with rounded corners and 4 feet. Put it on the table. Again, make sure that the knobs form straight rows and columns in front of you. Find 1 medium stone grey brick 1x1 with horizontal side clasp. Put it on the rightmost knob of the second row from the back, clasp to the back. Find 2 medium stone grey roof tiles 2x2, 45°. Put 1 to the left of the previous piece, slope to the back. Make sure the piece is flush with the back edge of the base plate. Put the other one on the 4 frontmost middle knobs, slope to the front. ### Conversation:\n",

Put the other one vertically on the leftmost column at the top. If done correctly, there are 4 knobs left between these two pieces. Next, we build the Block 2 module. Collect the following 2 pieces: 1 medium stone grey plate 1x2, and 1 medium stone grey plate 1x2 with side bottom tube. Hold the plate 1x2 vertically in your hand. Put the plate with side bottom tube horizontally on the back knob, side bottom tube to the right. Find another medium stone grey plate 1x2 with side bottom tube. Put it horizontally in front of the previous piece, side bottom tube again to the right. Find 1 pale ocher yellow connector peg 3m with friction ring. Insert the longer end of the connector peg into the bottom tube from the back. The shorter end will stick out towards the back. This is the block base. Continue for the Block itself. Next up, we will build the Block 2 itself. ### Conversation:\n",

The box contains a booklet with visual building instructions and bags. Open the bags carefully. Before you get started, ask a sighted person to sort them by color. This way, finding the correct brick will be even faster! Insert the cross axle front-to-back into the cross hole on the left. Find 1 medium stone grey brick 1x2 with 2 holes. The next part can be hard. Make sure to ask for help if needed. Insert the 2 connectors at the front into the 2 holes of the brick 1x2. Now, mount this build: put it on the second row from the back, to the left of the roof tile 1x2 with lattice. Make sure the cross axle is overhanging to the back. Good job. You have finished the first small build. Now, we will make the second small build. Find 1 dark stone grey technic beam 2m with cross hole. Put it horizontally on the table, holes front to back. This time the cross hole should be on the right. Find 1 black connector peg with middle friction ring. Insert it front-to-back into the round hole on the left.

This set comes with Cole and his cool speeder car. We also will build Hausner and his hoverboard. Hausner is the bad guy in this set. The play is that Cole attempts to escape being trapped inside the dangerous video game Prime Empire. Cole needs to defeat Hausner and keep hold of the prized Key-Tana. On the box cover Cole is sitting in his car being chased by Hausner on the hoverboard. Hausner tries to capture Cole with his chain and prime controller weapon. Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains a booklet with visual building instructions, and unnumbered bags. A wagon bottom 4x10 with 4 side connectors also lies loose in the box. Before you get started, ask a sighted person to help you sort the pieces by color. This way it will be easier for you to find the right pieces during building. ### Conversation:\n",

Imagine some trainee's utterances have the intent of using the tools with the following responses: Called the Unity tool <HighlightCorrectComponents> and got a response: Highlighted correct attachment points and components. Called the Unity tool <Shrink> and got a response: Shrunk or zoomed in the current object. Called the Unity tool <ShowPieces> and got a response: Showing all candidate LEGO pieces to be assembled. ### Guidelines: LEGO Audio & Braille Building Instructions for LEGO Marvel Spider-Man set \"Spider-Man Mech\". This set contains Spider-Man and his Spider-Man mech! Once inside this gigantic mechanical spider-robot, Spider-Man can go anywhere, grab anything and shoot massive webs! Villains beware… Spider-Mech is coming for you! Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! The box contains a booklet with visual building instructions and 3 bags. Ask a sighted person to help you find the correct bag! Carefully open bag 1. Before you start building, ask a sighted person to help you sort the bricks by color if you like. This way, finding the right piece will be even quicker! First, we will build the Spider-Man minifigure. Find 1 bright blue pair of legs. Find 1 bright blue and bright red upper part of the body. Stack it on top of the legs. Find 1 bright red head. Put it on top. The minifigure Spider-Man is finished! Well done! Next, we will build 3 Spider-Man web weapons.

Vulture’s stealing jewels from the bank truck! He swoops down from the sky, blasts the back off the truck, grabs the jewel boxes with a chain, and flies away with the stolen treasure. Spider-Man speeds in on his motorbike to save the day. Look out, Spidey! Vulture’s dropping jewels everywhere! Can Spider-Man catch Vulture in his web, or will the winged villain escape? Only you can decide! On the box cover, Spider-Man is soaring in mid-air on his motorbike, chasing after Vulture who is just about to steal a juwel safe from the back of the green and grey bank truck. The truck driver is trying her best to maneuver the truck away from the thief, but thanks to his wings Vulture is faster! Will Spider-Man be able to prevent the crime? Open the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! Find 1 mossy green and dark stone grey upper part of the body. Put it on top of the legs. Vulture is wearing a skin-tight mossy green jumpsuit; you can even see his six-pack through the fabric. The suit has a bright green collar that looks like a web. Find 1 bright yellowish green pair of Minifigure wings. Put the hole on the wings around Vulture's neck. Make sure the feathers are pointing down. Find 1 light nougat brown head. Put it on top. Vulture's expression is grim; he has a lot of wrinkles and scars, and silvery-white eyebrows. Find 1 bright red dynamite bundle with fuse. Put it in Vulture's left hand. Next, we will build a gold safe and Vulture's harpoon weapon. Find 1 white mailbox casing 2x2x2. ### Conversation:\n",
